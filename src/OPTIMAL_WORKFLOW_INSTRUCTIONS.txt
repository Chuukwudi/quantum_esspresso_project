=== OPTIMAL QE WORKFLOW FOR STANFORD PROJECT ===

## COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY

This package implements the optimal DFT workflow:
1. **Structural relaxation** → Find lowest energy geometry  
2. **Geometry extraction** → Extract relaxed atomic positions
3. **Final SCF calculation** → Accurate electronic structure on optimized geometry

This ensures both geometric and electronic convergence for reliable energy comparisons.

## SETUP

1. Install Quantum ESPRESSO:
   brew install quantum-espresso  # or conda install

2. Extract package and setup:
   unzip stanford_qe_full_optimal_collaboration.zip
   cd collaboration_package_full_optimal
   chmod +x setup_mac_optimal.sh scripts/*.py
   ./setup_mac_optimal.sh

## AUTOMATED WORKFLOW

3. Run complete automated workflow:
   chmod +x run_optimal_workflow.sh
   ./run_optimal_workflow.sh

   This automatically runs all steps for all systems.

## MANUAL WORKFLOW (if you prefer step-by-step)

For each system (system1, system2, system3):

4. Run relaxation:
   cd system1
   pw.x < ../input_files/system1_relax.in > system1_relax.out 2>&1

5. Extract relaxed geometry:
   python3 ../scripts/extract_geometry.py system1_relax.out system1

6. Run final SCF on relaxed structure:
   pw.x < system1_scf_on_relaxed.in > system1_scf_on_relaxed.out 2>&1

7. Repeat for system2 and system3

## RESULTS TO RETURN

Send back:
- stanford_qe_optimal_results.tar.gz (all output files)
- calculation_log.txt (summary of what completed)

## EXPECTED COMPUTATION TIME

Light version: 8-20 hours total
Full version: 24-72 hours total

The optimal workflow takes longer but provides publication-quality accuracy.
